## Logging - Wireline

Drilling the well alone wonâ€™t tell us if there is any oil and gas underground.

Well logging is the action of lowering remote sensors and instruments into the well to acquire necessary information about the rocks to better understand the oil and gas potential of the well. Well logging can be done while drilling, called ["Logging While Drilling"](../subpages/lwd.html) (also called "Measurement While Drilling") or by [Wireline](../subpages/wireline.html).
