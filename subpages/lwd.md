## Logging - Wireline

Drilling the well alone wonâ€™t tell us if there is any oil and gas underground.

Well logging is the practice of making detailed record of the properties of the rock and fluids of the downhole reservoir. It is required to understand the oil and gas potential of the well. Well logging can be done while drilling, called ["Logging While Drilling"](../subpages/lwd.html) (also called "Measurement While Drilling") or by [Wireline](../subpages/wireline.html).
