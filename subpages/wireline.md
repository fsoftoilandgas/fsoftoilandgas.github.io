## Logging - Wireline

Drilling the well alone wonâ€™t tell us if there is any oil and gas underground.

Well logging is the practice of making detailed record of the properties of the rock and fluids of the downhole reservoir. It is required to understand the oil and gas potential of the well. Well logging can be done while drilling, called ["Logging While Drilling"](../subpages/lwd.html) (also called "Measurement While Drilling") or by [Wireline](../subpages/wireline.html).

Wireline logging is performed by lowering a "logging tool" - or a string of one or more instruments - on the end of an electrical cable (wireline) into the well and recording downhole data. This data is then analyzed by a specialist (most of the time the Petrophysicist), and the resulting intepretation is used to assess the economic viability of the oilfield.

Wireline logging is usually done by services company. Services company may offer one or more of different logging tool, each contains sensors that measure a specific set of data.

There are a wide range of technologies employed by wireline logging. Details of some of which are listed below.

* Radioactive logs
* Electrical logs
* Sonic logs
* Mechanical logs
* Nuclear Magnetic Resonance logs
