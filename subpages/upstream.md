## Upstream - Oil and Gas Exploration and Production

Upstream sector includes searching for and all subsequent works to brings crude oil or gas from underground to the surface.

Nearly all of the more commonly known activities in the oil and gas industry happen in the upstream sector. 

Upstream activity usually start with performing neccessary survey to idenfity potential field, then drilling wells to acquire data for analysis. If the field has economic value, it will be developed to produce oil (and/or gas). When the production declines to below the economic value, decision will be made to stop production and decommision is done to safely shut down the field.

The table below lists some of the most common works and services that maybe carried out during the exploration and production phase.

### Pre-drilling preparations 
| Seismic survey | Oilfield mapping | Safety survey and assessment |
### Exploration and development - Drilling and related activities
| [Drilling](../subpages/drilling.html) | Drilling fluid | Gyro survey | Well control
| Mud logging | Logging - while drilling | Logging - Wireline
| Casing service | Cementing | Well Integrity | Perforation
| Testing | Production logging | Completion |
### Production and ongoing maintenance
| Artificial Lift | Well Intervention | Enhance Oil Recovery
| Coil-tubing | Slickline | Production monitoring |
### Software services
