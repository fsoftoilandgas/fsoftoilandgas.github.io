## Organization of a typical Oil Services Company

Service company plays a vital role in the oil and gas industry. They employ specialized equipments and dedicated workers to help the oil company realizing their goal, that is, to extract and produce as much oil and gas as possible from the ground.

Besides the three major service comanies, namely Schlumberger, Halliburton and BakerHuge, there are literally thousands of other service company operating around the world. Smaller companies tend to be very specialized, they may offer only one or two kind of products or services. Larger company may offer hundreds or more services, as such their organization must be adequately structured to support the huge operation.

Service company usually organized into different disciplines (also called "segments"). Each discipline or segment serve a particular part of the exploration and production cycle.

In larger company, each discipline or segment would have their own president, ie vertical management structure. The vertical structure allows the company to ensure their discipline/segment is in sharp focus to deliver the best service to the customer. Several disciplines/segments can be grouped together into a larger group, differentiated by the stage of the oilfield life cycle they serve in.

Service company is also organized geographically (horizontally), in countries where they are based. Country with larger operation may have their own chairman or president. Country with smaller operation may group together in a "Geomarket" type. This allows sharing of common services across different country. The horizontal structure allows the company to adapt to local business environment, including differences in law, custom, or geopolitics.

Oilfield service company often have their own research center and manufactoring plant. This allow them to find and develop new technologies to employ in the industry.

### Schlumberger

Schlumberger has both vertical (segment/product line) and horizontal (geographic) type of organization. 

Geographically, North America is always an important market for every player, so it has its own president to ensure focused attention. The rest of the world is then split to Easten and Western hemisphere, each covering a large geographic area.

Vertically, each segment would have its own president. Employees in each segment have deep understanding of what they do, and normally don't cross over to other segment. Cross over typically only happen for managers.

Schlumberger has several research centers located around the world. It also has its own software research center to produce a wide range of oilfield software.

Schlumberger mainly focuses on the upstream Oil and Gas.
