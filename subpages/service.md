## Organization of a typical Oil Services Company

Service company plays a vital role in the oil and gas industry. They employ specialized equipments and dedicated workers to help the oil company realizing their goal, that is, to extract and produce as much oil and gas as possible from the ground.

Besides the three major service comanies, namely Schlumberger, Halliburton and BakerHuge, there are literally thousands of other service company operating around the world. Smaller companies tend to be very specialized, they may offer only one or two kind of products or services. Larger company may offer hundreds or more services, as such their organization must be adequately structured to support the huge operation.

Service company usually organized into different disciplines (also called "segments"). Each discipline or segment serve a particular part of the exploration and production cycle.

In larger company, each discipline or segment would have their own president, ie vertical management structure. The vertical structure allows the company to ensure their discipline/segment is in sharp focus to deliver the best service to the customer. Several disciplines/segments can be grouped together into a larger group, differentiated by the stage of the oilfield life cycle they serve in.

Service company is also organized geographically (horizontally), in countries where they are based. Country with larger operation may have their own chairman or president. Country with smaller operation may group together in a "Geomarket" type. This allows sharing of common services across different country. The horizontal structure allows the company to adapt to local business environment, including differences in law, custom, or geopolitics.

Oilfield service company often have their own research center and manufactoring plant. This allow them to find and develop new technologies to employ in the industry.
