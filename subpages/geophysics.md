The seismic method is based on the propagation of elastic waves in the earth and their reflection and refraction due to changes in the earthâ€™s velocity-density distribution. Active sources of energy are required; dynamite, air guns, and chirp signal generators are the most widely used sources. 
Detection of faint pressure or particle motion at or near the surface is achieved by use of sensitive pressure gauges or geophones. The received signal is amplified, recorded (usually by digital methods), processed (usually in a digital computer),
and displayed in a form that is interpretable in terms of geologic structure, stratigraphy, and hydrocarbon content (**Fig.1**).
